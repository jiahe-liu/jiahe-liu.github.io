I am a graduate student in computer science at [China University of Petroleum, Beijing](https://www.cup.edu.cn/cupai/index.htm), focusing on AI, machine learning, and computer vision. I completed my undergraduate studies at the same university, where I developed a strong foundation in programming and algorithms, winning national competitions. My research includes improving pose-guided image generation, enhancing tactile sensing using Electrical Impedance Tomography, and advancing techniques in computer vision.

I contributed to a paper on visual-language models for background subtraction, which was accepted at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) workshop. During my masterâ€™s studies, I spent a year as an exchange student at Khalifa University in the UAE, where I worked on tactile sensing using Electrical Impedance Tomography, focusing on reconstructing tactile data through techniques inspired by computer vision and signal processing. I had the privilege of being advised by Associate Professor [Dandan Zhu](https://www.cup.edu.cn/cupai/szdw/jsml/856a0903b2ea4e78a1e6001ba846b9d3.htm) from [China University of Petroleum, Beijing](https://www.cup.edu.cn/cupai/index.htm) and Professor [Panos Liatsis](https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/panos-liatsis) from [Khalifa University](https://www.ku.ac.ae/department/department-of-computer-science#about).

Previously, I interned at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), where I optimized automated testing processes and improved system efficiency.

Currently, I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in computer vision and AI.
